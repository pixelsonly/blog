:body: "Ever since I started using my GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition on motorycle rides
  I found the capture button somewhat limiting and unreliable. It can be a little
  tricky to fully press the button on the camera or the WiFi remote while wearing
  leather gloves and at high speed. \n\nOther times it can be difficult to quickly
  determine if the GoPro is capturing or not. The WiFi remote makes things easier
  but it's still not easy to feel the weather-resistant button through gloves. I also
  like to try different mounting spots with suction cup which means I can't always
  physically reach for it.\n\nI decided to experiment with the WiFi remote and see
  if I could extend a set of jumper leads out to a physical switch. I figured I could
  live without the accessory switch in my main controls for flashing the highbeam
  and repurpose it for something a little more fun.\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2524610/pixelsonly/articles/gopro-physical-trigger/step_1.jpg\"><img

  the GoPro WiFi remote is definitely not for everyone. This took a little patience
  and quite a few tools to pull off.\n\n<figure>\n  <a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2524610/pixelsonly/articles/gopro-physical-trigger/step_2.jpg\"><img

  \ <figcaption>Finished product</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI've tested the finished
  product on multiple rides and couldn't be happier. It allows me to be more efficient
  with the GoPro's limited battery life by capturing with much better precision and
  reliability. "
