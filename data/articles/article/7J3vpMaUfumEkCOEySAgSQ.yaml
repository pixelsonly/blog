:blurb: 'There''s no denying how much fun a GoPro can be when riding a motorcycle.
  However, when used outside of the a "dashcam" context, I soon discovered it''s not
  so easy to start/stop recording wearing leather gloves and reaching for a tiny button
  at speed. I''m happy to share my DIY solution to this problem by creating a physical
  trigger attached to the motorcycle''s bars. '
:body: "Ever since I started using my [GoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition](http://amzn.to/2jbLdnu)
  on motorycle rides I found the capture button somewhat limiting and unreliable.
  It can be a little tricky to fully press the button on the camera or the WiFi remote
  while wearing leather gloves and at high speed. \n\nOther times it can be difficult
  to quickly determine if the GoPro is capturing or not. The WiFi remote makes things
  easier but it's still not easy to feel the weather-resistant button through gloves.
  I also like to try different mounting spots with suction cup which means I can't
  always physically reach for it.\n\nI decided to experiment with the WiFi remote
  and see if I could extend a set of jumper leads out to a physical switch. I figured
  I could live without the accessory switch in my main controls for flashing the highbeam
  and repurpose it for something a little more fun.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//images.contentful.com/v4zq60bqlwhq/7k4KWYjizmOyY2M2Ue2uyk/41bc4f435fb2e8a40e89c2590bcd0fdc/step_1.jpg\">\n
  \ <figcaption>Soldiering leads onto the circuit board of the GoPro WiFi remote</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nModifying
  the GoPro WiFi remote is definitely not for everyone. This took a little patience
  and quite a few tools to pull off.\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"//images.contentful.com/v4zq60bqlwhq/m58ZGvhVdeCuq4aiEmeGk/30ab261dc64e5f592f1a7f39d7cd4a7d/step_2.jpg\">\n

  product on multiple rides and couldn't be happier. It allows me to be more efficient
  with the GoPro's limited battery life by capturing with much better precision and
  reliability. "
