:body: "**Thoughts on code review in a fast-paced environment**\n\nIt doesn't need
  to be painful, it should be embraced as part of your team's culture. At Rails Conf
  2015, Derek Prior from Thoughtbot gave a talk about code review where he summed
  it up quite well, \"Code reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews
  are about socialization, learning and teaching.\"\n\n---\n\n\"The process is more
  important than the result.\"\n\n\"Code review is the discipline of discussing your
  code with your peers.\"\n\n---\n\nAs an author, what problem is it solving? What
  value will be provided to the reviewer?\n\nChallenge: provide 2 paragraphs of context
  for a given change\n\n---\n\nAs a reviewer... \"Ask, don't tell\"\n\nResearch has
  shown that written feedback is more often perceived as negative than if the same
  feedback was given in-person.\n\n---\n\nCode review shouldn't be approached as an
  automated task to be completed as quickly as possible. It is a vital part of the
  software development process that fosters knowledge transfer and best practices
  across the entire team. It is meant to be a discussion where potential alternatives
  should be considered while providing deeper understanding for the reviewer. Shared
  knowledge empowers a team and distributes the critical path.\n\n**How should we
  perform code review? Ask questions. Have a conversation.**\n\nDoes the code meet
  our standards?\n* Syntax errors or typos\n* Code style\n* No dead code\n* Idiomatic
  use of the frameworks and libraries\n\nDoes the code accomplish what the author
  intended?\n* Handles all edge-cases appropriately\n* Tests pass in a non-trivial
  manner\n* Logic should be understandable for any developer\n\n**Code review takes
  time. It's supposed to.**\n\nThe time and effort spent during review will naturally
  result in better code with fewers bugs while exposing more developers to a specific
  area of the code base.\n\nThere will be occassions where a reviewer will need more
  context surrounding the code and/or problem being solved. Rather than having the
  reviewer spend significant time and effort digging in it could be more effective
  to pair up with the author and have them walk through the changes. This will provide
  and opportunity for the reviewer to ask questions and achieve a deeper understanding.\n\n**Being
  an effective reviewer**\n\nCommon courtesy and politeness go a long way but not
  everyone takes critique well. As developers, it's imperative that we recognize the
  feedback is aimed at the code and nothing personal.\n\nAs a reviewer, feedback can
  be given in a constructive manner by asking questions such as \"What do you think
  about...?\", \"Did you consider...?\" or \"Could you explain...?\".\n\nWhen an author
  does something well, recognize them for it. This is literally why we have emoji.
