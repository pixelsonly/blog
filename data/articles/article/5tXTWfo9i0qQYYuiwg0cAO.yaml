:body: "### Demise of the Boxee Box\nMy Boxee box has been the key component of my
  home entertainment setup for the past few years. I've recommended it to family &
  friends numerous times. Unfortunately, Boxee continues to disregard & alienate it's
  most loyal customers. Now, with the Samsung acquisition underway & official news
  of more abandonement, I have decided to cut my losses & move on.\n\n\n### Considering
  Alternatives\nThere are quite a few streaming devices on the market right now. Obvious
  options like Apple TV & Roku are compelling, but don't meet my current usage needs
  entirely. I don't want to lose the ability to stream my personal media library,
  & I'm not interested in jumping through the hoops to make it work. I'd also like
  access to apps such as Netflix & Pandora.\n\nMy media library weighs in around 4TB
  and lives on Network Attached Storage in a variety of popular formats and codecs
  (h.264/x264, mp3, aac, flac, etc). My ideal device needs to play a wide range of
  formats/codecs, have access to popular apps/services, a decent user-interface, make
  minimal noise & a decent remote iOS app.\n\n#### Competition Lineup\n\n**[Roku 3](http://www.roku.com/meet-roku)**\n
  \ \n* excellent user-interface\n* variety of popular apps and services\n* limited
  codec support\n* no access to network content, shares, etc\n* HDMI output only\n*
  nice iOS remote app\n\n**[Apple TV](https://www.apple.com/appletv/)**\n  \n* exceptional
  user-interface\n* high quality apps & services\n* AirPlay\n* iTunes access & shared
  content\n* extremely limited codec support\n* HDMI + optical audio output\n\n**[WD
  TV Live](http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330)**\n  \n* clean, customizable
  & user-friendly interface\n* variety of popular apps & services\n* massive format
  & codec support \n* personal media library feature\n* full access to network shares
  and content\n* HDMI, optical audio & component output\n* fully functional iOS remote
  app\n\n\n#### Winner: WD TV Live\n\nThe **WD TV Live** is the clear winner for me
  due to it's clean interface and ability to play a wide array of media formats and
  codecs. The user-interface well designed, but I still prefer the overall aesthetic
  of the **Roku 3** and **Apple TV**. One of the key strengths of the **Boxee Box**
  is the media library functionality that automatically displays metadata from IMDB
  & other external sources. The **WD TV Live** doesn't exceed the **Boxee Box** in
  this area, but it works & it's the best offering at this time. Also, I really like
  the ability to send optical or analog audio to my hi-fi audio setup in lieu of HDMI.\n\nOn
  first boot, the **WD TV Live** presented a clean interface and since I was connected
  to the internet via ethernet it immediately notified me of a firmware update. During
  the firmware update process I installed the iOS remote app and it automatically
  detected the device after it rebooted. I did run into an issue with the HDMI cable
  I was using with my Boxee box, so I swapped it out for another I had on-hand. I'm
  not sure what the issue was there. Connecting to my network attached storage was
  quick & painless. I tested several files of various formats i.e. .mkv, .mpg, .mov
  and .flac with no issues. The iOS remote app is quite useful & solves some other
  **Boxee Box** issues like not being able to control the volume level while in the
  Netflix app. Overall the remote app makes entering complex usernames and passwords
  trivial, except for some minor issues with the keyboard input while logging into
  the Netflix app. Something was up with the copy/paste but I'm not sure if this was
  an issue with the iOS remote app, the Netflix app or some combination.\n\n### Final
  Thoughts\n\nOverall, I am quite happy with my choice and my expectations have been
  exceeded. I realize that my technical knowledge and use case is not typical. That
  being said, I'm not sure I'd recommend a **WD TV Live** to my parents but I definitely
  would to anyone that is a current **Boxee Box** user or someone looking for power-user
  type features not offered by the competition.\n\n**[Buy WD TV Live on Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KOZNBW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005KOZNBW&linkCode=as2&tag=pixelsonly-20)**\n\n---\n\n###
  Update: July 15, 2013\n\nAfter a few days of average use I've decided to post a
  follow up with more details. Overall, I'm still mostly satisfied with the **WD TV
  Live**, but I did run into a pretty big snag after the second day of use. During
  the initial setup I added several network shares to the Media Library feature which
  includes over 300 HD movies and over 80GB of music. Once the indexing was finished
  the **WD TV Live** slowed dramatically, the UI was barely usable and apps like Netflix
  ran poorly. Also, the Netflix app would freeze the unit when queueing up videos,
  which required a reboot to get working again.\n\nI have since disabled the *Media
  Library* functionality entirely. I can still navigate my network shares&mdash;find
  movies & play albums, but it's going to take me awhile no longer miss the **Boxee
  Box** interface.\n\n---\n\n### Update: July 21, 2013\n\nI've spent several weeks
  with my **WD TV Live** and the experience keeps changing. I've had to completely
  disable the *Media Library* feature in order to gain extra system stability. Unfortunately
  that doesn't seem to have solved everything. I believe there are real perfomance
  issues with the Netflix app as it continues to hang at different times, especially
  when queueing up TV episodes back to back. I am fortunate to be a Verizon FiOS customer
  with a 75/35 Mbps connection, so I definitely don't have bandwidth issues. The Netflix
  iPad app doesn't experience these issues, my gut is telling me these are platform
  specific problems.\n\nI really want to like the **WD TV Live**, but inconsistent
  performance and stability tarnish it's reputation the more you use it. To be fair,
  the Netflix issues could very well not be the device's fault because I've noticed
  similarities on other devices like Roku. I'm probably going to boot my **Boxee Box**
  up again and give it another chance.\n\n---\n\n### Update: July 25, 2013\n\nI returned
  the **WD TV Live** back to Amazon today. Over the past few weeks I've spent more
  timef trying to get the **WD TV Live** to work than I have actually enjoying content.
  I've decided to give Apple TV another shot and see if I can live without all the
  features and functionality I've grown accustomed to. Apple's AirPlay functionality
  works well and is proving more useful than I anticipated. All that being said, I
  still think there is room for competition in this space. If there was a box that
  provided the \"app-like\" experience of Apple TV, the Media Library and codec support
  of Boxee I'd gladly pay $200 or more for it."
