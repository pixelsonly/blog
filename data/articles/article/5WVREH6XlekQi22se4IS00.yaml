:blurb: The latest mesh network technology and hardware are finally making WiFi feel
  like less of a compromise over traditional hardwired LANs. There are quite a few
  hardware options from brands large and small, each with their own strengths and
  weakness.
:body: "The next generation in consumer WiFi hardware is here with a few big players
  like [Google](https://madeby.google.com/wifi/) and [Netgear](http://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/orbi/?cid=us-orbi-srch&utm_source=search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=q117-us-orbi-search&gclid=CjwKEAiA_p_FBRCRi_mW5Myl4S0SJAAkezZrPIe4McjiXapEeDfXzYHkvpIIR6MZqlfAtl5h49KkNRoCn9bw_wcB)
  going up against smaller brands such as [Luma](https://lumahome.com), and [Eero](https://eero.com).\n\nA
  [Wireless mesh network - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network)
  (WMN) is fundamentally different than a traditional WiFi router. With a mesh network,
  you connect one or more nodes to your modem, which will blanket your space with
  a single network. Say goodbye to switching between access points or jumping between
  frequency bands.\n\n## Why go mesh?\nMy experience over the past few months with
  my own WMN has been very positive. The WiFi dead zones that had plagued parts of
  our living space are gone and overall network performance is noticeably better and
  more reliable. Having a solid network becomes ever more important as we connect
  more of our home and lives in general to the Internet.\n\n### Key benefits\n* Can
  handle larger number of wireless devices\n* Network speeds can be comparable to
  a hardwired LAN\n* Excellent alternative if you can’t install ethernet\n* More performant
  and reliable than WiFi range extenders\n* Simple setup and configuration via Apps\n\n##
  Hardware Options\nAfter deciding which brand meets your needs best, it’s just a
  matter of determining how many hubs you want to start with. Every brand sells individual
  hubs for a modest price, but unless you have a small studio apartment, personally
  I’d recommend buying a 2 or 3-pack and going from there.\n\n### Helpful Reviews\n\n-

  Why Luma?\nAfter much reading and consideration I determined the best hardware for
  my needs was a [Luma 3-pack](http://amzn.to/2lYBZcX). Luma has a compelling product
  with all of the features I was looking for. \n\nOur home has an L-shaped floor plan
  and my goal was to have network coverage throughout for connecting all of our devices,
  smart home accessories as well as a [Plex media server](https://www.plex.tv) and
  [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage).\n\nLuma, Orbi, Eero
  and Google WiFi all offer similar features and use the exact same Qualcomm silicon
  (AC1300). However, the features that make Luma stand apart are related to initial
  setup, device prioritization, security, and Alexa integration.\n\nNetgear’s Orbi
  is the only offering in the mix that has multiple ethernet ports and a usable USB
  2.0 port, which was an initial concern I had with Luma, but found it to be a non-issue
  after some use.\n\n### Likes\n- 24/7 phone or chat support\n- Elegant hardware design
  & form factor\n- Regular OTA firmware updates\n- Security / malware notifications\n-
  iOS app for network management\n\n### Dislikes\n- Unusable USB 2.0 port\n- Inability
  to set custom DNS servers"
