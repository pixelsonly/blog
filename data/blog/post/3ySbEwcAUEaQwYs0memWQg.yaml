  To my surprise, my [Leap Motion](http://www.leapmotion.com) arrived a few days early. I noticed some Tweets from others experiencing the same thing&mdash;it's always fun getting new toys. As soon as I saw the box, my first thought was "How soon until I can get a Hello World?" Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do with it right now, unless you were accepted into the beta program. I was ready to drop everything else I was planning on doing today. **I feel like a kid on Christmas morning with a brand new toy and no batteries.**
