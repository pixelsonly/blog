:body: "For the past few years I've been geo-caching my favorite motorcycle rides
  with the [Motion-X GPS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}
  for iOS. It's a great app with tons of features and functionality but it was only
  solving part of my problem. What I really want is the ability to load my pre-planned
  or saved routes with turn by turn navigation and voice guidance. I have a power
  adapter for my iPhone on my motorcyle so I have no issues with constant GPS usage
  and power consumption.\n\nLately I've been pre-planning routes in Google Maps but
  then I have to jump through all kinds of hoops to get the data converted into a
  proprietary format for some app that might or might not work. It's been frustrating
  to say the least.\n\nEverything I've tried over the past few months has either been
  cumbersome or unreliable. Just to be clear, I've been looking for an iOS based solution
  without having to spend several hundred dollars on a standalone navigation unit
  that would need additional power and mounting. \n\n[Motion-X GPS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps/id299949744?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n
  \ \n* awesome GPS tracking and geo caching but doesn't offer turn by turn navigation
  of saved routes\n\n[Motion-X Drive](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motionx-gps-drive/id328095974?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n
  \ \n* decent navigation but doesn't allow importing of custom routes\n\n[Google
  Maps](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\n*
  great turn by turn navigation with voice guidance and re-routing, but doesn't allow
  importing of custom maps\n\n[Google Earth](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\n*
  will load saved maps from my Google account but does not offer turn by turn navigation
  with voice guidance\n\n[Sygic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sygic-gps-navigation-offline/id585193266?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\n*
  requires a proprietary file format that I was never able to get working on OSX\n\n[Cycle
  Meter](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cyclemeter-gps-cycling-running/id330595774?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\n*
  a beautiful app that allows importing of custom routes but is tailored for cyclists
  and not ideal for motorcycling\n\nI've read that [Navigon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navigon-north-america/id321506742?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}
  has some of the features I'm looking for but I've been burned before and I'm not
  looking to waste $40 on something that might not work.\n\n## Then it dawned on me&hellip;\n\nRather
  than try and create maps on my desktop, convert and import to iOS, maybe someone
  already has an iOS app for creating custom maps with turn by turn navigation. **BINGO**.
  It's called [Mapkin](http://mapkin.co){:target=\"_blank\"} and it's amazing. [Here
  is the App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mapkin-maps-gps-personalized/id700227307?mt=8){:target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nI
  built a route from Huntington Beach to Rancho Palos Verdes. I wanted to test how
  well Mapkin works in the real world with many turns and mixed road types. From the
  beginning I was impressed with Mapkin's UI and it's ease of use. I finished my first
  custom map in a few minutes. I usually like to build round-trip routes so I don't
  have to worry about getting home and Mapkin handled it perfectly.\n\n**Note:** The
  big image at the top of this post is the route I created with Mapkin.\n\nMapkin's
  Strengths\n\n* clean UI and exceptional usability\n* near perfect turn by turn navigation
  and voice guidance\n* will guide you to starting waypoint from your current location\n*
  it's **FREE**\n\nMapkin's Weaknesses\n\n* ability to create/edit maps on the web
  (they did say it's coming soon)\n* it would be nice to be able to import .gpx or
  .kml's but it's not a deal breaker\n\nI'm very excited to see where Mapkin is going.
  It's a fantastic piece of software and I wish them all the success in the world."
